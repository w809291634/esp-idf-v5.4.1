Supported Features:

- ``project_include.cmake``: add additional features like ``DIAGNOSTICS_COLOR`` to the project. The file will be automatically parsed, for details, please refer `project-include-cmake <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/api-guides/build-system.html#project-include-cmake>`__.
- ``package_manager.cmake``: provides functions to manager components' versions, etc.
- ``gcc.cmake``: manager the GCC compiler options like ``LTO`` through menuconfig.
- ``relinker.cmake`` provides a way to move IRAM functions to flash to save RAM space.
- ``gen_compressed_ota.cmake``: add new command ``idf.py gen_compressed_ota`` to generate ``xz`` compressed OTA binary. please refer `xz <https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution/tree/master/components/utilities/xz>`__.
- ``gen_single_bin.cmake``: add new command ``idf.py gen_single_bin`` to generate single combined bin file (combine app, bootloader, partition table, etc).

How to Use
----------

Use
---

1. Add dependency of this component in your component or project’s ``idf_component.yml``.

   .. code:: yaml

      dependencies:
        espressif/cmake_utilities: "0.*"

2. Include the CMake Features/Script in your component’s or project’s ``CMakeLists.txt`` after ``idf_component_register``.

   .. code:: none

      // Note: should remove .cmake postfix when using include(), otherwise the requested file will not found
      // Note: should place this line after `idf_component_register` function
      // only include the one you needed.
      include(package_manager)

3. Then you can use the corresponding features provided by the CMake script.
